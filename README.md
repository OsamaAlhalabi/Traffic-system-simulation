# Traffic Simulation System
Traffic simulation is a college project for the fourth year, specializing in artificial intelligence.
 * I used some assets to represent the road network architecture (streets -Traffic lights - paths).
 * I added two types of vehicles: vehicles with **AI controller** for self driving and a normal vehicles for user to drive.
 * I provided a `car manipulation` menu to control simulation environment parameters during `run time` such as:
    1. Number of vehicles (approximately 1000 vehicles).
    2. Speed of the vehicle.
    3. Safe distance between two vehicles.
    4. Speed of acceleration.
 * I also added the `Features` menu which gives the user the following features:
    1. Drive, follow and steer a car.
    2. Free roaming through the simulation.
    3. Drag and drop some obstacles such as buildings and trees.
    4. Show the map.
    5. Smart building (building the simulations by identifying the variables in an optimal way).
